Portfolio website
-------------------------------------

This portfolio contains all the projects I've completed so far, as well as an about page and home page. I'm adding to it and updating it every week, sometimes a few times a week, as it's where I put to practice what I learn in [the course I'm following](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

### Pages built so far...
*   🏠  Home page (very basic still, would like to improve this)
*   👩🏼‍💼  About me (pleased with how this part went, I created an interactive mini CV using Bootstrap and it is responsive and mobile friendly)
*   🖥  Projects (so far very basic, I would like to improve this when I have more projects to show)

### Projects already on this site...
*   🍌  Banana Quiz (18th April, first full coding project)
*   🔢  Number guessing game (3rd Oct, no HTML/CSS, only JS to practise if statements and for loops - to be improved in Nov)
*   ✅  To do list mini app
*   🥚  Pokemon list using JavaScript
*   🌈  Random colour generator
*   🏓  Ping pong score keeper
*   🦊  Random fox generator


### Future project ideas...
*   🪴  House plant tracker, where you can add plants by type and view info about care
*   🃏  Score keeper for 'Mus', a Spanish card game
*   🔎  Multi-language dictionary, showing translations and examples and possibly etymology 
*   ⏱  Time sheet, to track working hours and hours spent on various projects
*   📂  Text de-formatter, takes text from PDF etc and removes extra line breaks except where there are real paragraph breaks
*   📺  Home display screen showing weather, events, reminders etc, for use in the home
