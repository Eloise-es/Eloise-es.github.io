Portfolio website
-------------------------------------

This portfolio contains my coding projects, as well as an about page and home page. I am currently in the process of rebuilding it from scratch using React, so this version doesn't contain my latest projects.

### Pages built so far...
*   🏠  Home page (very basic still, would like to improve this)
*   👩🏼‍💼  About me (pleased with how this part went, I created an interactive mini CV using Bootstrap and it is responsive and mobile friendly)
*   🖥  Projects (so far very basic, I would like to improve this when I have more projects to show)

### Projects already on this site...
*   🍌  Banana Quiz (18th April, first full coding project)
*   🔢  Number guessing game
*   ✅  To do list mini app
*   🥚  Pokemon list using JavaScript
*   🌈  Random colour generator
*   🏓  Ping pong score keeper
*   🦊  Random fox generator
*   📺  TV Show search app


### Future project ideas...
*   🪴  House plant tracker, where you can add plants by type and view info about care
*   🃏  Score keeper for 'Mus', a Spanish card game
*   🔎  Multi-language dictionary, showing translations and examples and possibly etymology 
*   ⏱  Time sheet, to track working hours and hours spent on various projects
*   📂  Text de-formatter, takes text from PDF etc and removes extra line breaks except where there are real paragraph breaks
*   🌦️  Home display screen showing weather, events, reminders etc, for use in the home
*   🥘  Mini recipe website with some of my favourite recipes
*   🚗  Car comparison site, where you add details of the cars and it compares their cost over time
